DayZ Dr Jones Trader TraderObjects.txt File To Spawn Trader Base on LIVONIA at 8737.54 / 8051.47, SE of Zapadlisko

MANY THANKS TO DR JONES FOR CREATING THIS MOD! Livonia Trader Base created by scalespeeder. See https://www.youtube.com/ScalespeederGaming

YOU MUST HAVE DR JONES TRADER INSTALLED AND WORKING FOR THIS FILE TO WORK!

REMEMBER TO ADD THE TRADER ITEMS TO YOUR LIVONIA (ENOCH) TYPES.XML! SEE https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1590841260

To download the files, click on the Green "Code" button, then "Download" and unzip the files to your local PC drive.

To spawn a Trader Base in at 8737.54 / 8051.47, South East of Zapadlisko, simply upload the supplied TraderObjects.txt file to the Trader Config folder,
which is inside your servers Profile / Config folder, over the top of the existing TraderObjects file. (Make a copy of the original for if you want to swap
back to a Chernrus Server, or another map.)

Also included is a LIVONIA-TRADER.dze file, which can be loaded into the DayZ Editor Mod, and if you open the file in the Livonia (Enoch) map,
you could use it as a basis to customise the Trader Base to your own liking (although you will need to be familiar with how to edit the TraderObject.txt file,
and those instructions are not included here.)

Restart your server and the Trader will spawn in.
